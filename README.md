This blocklist is fetched from https://github.com/Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist/Ultimate.Hosts.Blacklist, I don't mean to be the owner of this blocklist, im just using this repo to convert this blocklist from hosts to ublock/adguard/abp syntaxes. I don't have a donation thingy since I don't deserve nor need the money anyway because im just converting, not adding, if you want to contribute, go to [the person who made this blocklist](https://github.com/Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist/Ultimate.Hosts.Blacklist), if you want to submit issues, go to the [the person who made this blocklist](https://github.com/Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist/Ultimate.Hosts.Blacklist), at this point, if you want to make any changes, any donation, any contributions, just anything! You need to go to the [the person who made this blocklist](https://github.com/Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist/Ultimate.Hosts.Blacklist), and also, don't be suprised if i may have skipped a day or two on updating the blocklist, but its for good reason like I forgot or im busy etc. Anyway I made this repo since a particular blocklist I liked didn't support adguard/ublock/abp syntaxes, and my priorities are to have a very comprehensive and wide spread blocklist, so this repo was made, ofc I can't make it private, or jsdelivr starts being annoying at me and doesn't work. I can't just rely on just github infrastructure, since this blocklist is so massive that copying it anywhere uses hundreds to thousands of ram, and i need this blocklist to load quickly as possible. Anyway, your free to use the blocklist, donations should go to the creator of the blocklist, not me.
